### Summary
The Carmin Watch is a sport watch that helps you keep track of your steps and body temperature during your activities
The key features of this watch are:
- Display real time on the display
- A button to start, stop, and reset tracking of your activity
- Reporting of your steps and body temperature every 10s and graphing it to a chart
- A buzzer alarm to alert you if you are overheating


### Self-Assessment 

| Objective Criterion | Rating | Max Value  | 
|---------------------------------------------|:-----------:|:---------:|
| Displays clock time on alpha display as HR:MIN | 1 |  1     | 
| Functions as a simple activity timer (start, stop, reset) | 1 |  1     | 
| Provides continuous reporting of steps per 10s interval to laptop | 1 |  1     | 
| Provides continuous reporting of body temperature per 10s interval to laptop | 1 |  1     | 
| Data at laptop plotted as stripcharts | 1 |  1     | 
| Provides alert function with buzzer on alarm | 1 |  1     | 


## Solution Design
blah blah blah

#### Step Tracking
Step tracking uses an accelerometer fine tuned to a certain threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, it counts as a step. This threshold is tuned so that a regular step should trigger the threshold.

#### Data Plotting
Data plotting is done through CanvasJS. The ESP32 writes sensor data to the serial port which is read by the JS file which then writes the sensor data into a csv file (for storage purposes), which is then read and updated to the nodeJS server. The nodeJS server checks for after updates to the csv file and pushes it to the sensor graphs in real-time.

#### Time Display
For time tracking we used an alphanumeric display that interfaces with the ESP32 using I2C. The time in the present is sent to the serial port from the nodeJS server once and is kept track of and incremented using the ESP32s own time tracking functionality.

#### Activity Tracking
